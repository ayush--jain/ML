### This is a collection of all the ML/AI projects I undertook in colllege. <br \> <br \>

**UNSUPERVISED LEARNING**: customer_segments <br \>
Used data from a wholesaler and divided customers in clusters based on their buying habits. This enabled the wholesaler to conduct A/B testing for different clusters for studying impact of different delivery schedules on sales.
