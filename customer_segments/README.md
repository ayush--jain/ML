Consumer data from a wholesaler. Predicting user behavior when delivery schedules would be changed.
Use of unsupervised learning techniques to help make clusters(using K means algo) to classify consumers for easier A/B testing. Dimensionality reduction using PCA and feature scaling done using natural log. Visualizations done using matplotlib.
