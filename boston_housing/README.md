**SUPERVISED LEARNING**: In this project, I predict the price of a house in Boston based on a few features stated below. <br \>

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The features The features 'RM', 'LSTAT', 'PTRATIO', and 'MDEV'have only been considered as rest were not relevant. <br\>

RM- no of rooms <br\>

LSTAT- percentage of people with net worth more than the avg of the neighborhood in the city <br\>

PTRATIO - ratio of students to teachers in schools <br\>

MDEV- the price of the home <br\>


PS: the data is from 1978 and is only an academic project which should not be used to analyze current trends. The feature 'MDEV' has been multiplicatively scaled to account for 35 years of market inflation.
