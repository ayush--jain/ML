**SUPERVISED LEARNING**
This is a project to determine if the student is likely to graduate or not and hence provide them timely intervention. 
We use data from a school that includes previous pass, fail data along with 28 other features which we use to make our prediction.
3 famous algorithms have been used and the most efficient of them was then fine tuned to achieve an accuracy of 82.58%
